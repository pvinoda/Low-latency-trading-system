# Low-latency-trading-system
A trading system that functions in real time with servers written in Rust to achieve low latency. Speed is primarily achieved through the techniques used in data compression, data transmission and regional distribution of servers

The system will be built as part of my CSC724: Advanced Distributed Systems course project. Plans are in place to design a UI for this infrastructure with React/React Native.
